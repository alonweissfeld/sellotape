# Sellotape

Sellotape is a modern audio podcast platform.
It introduces an accessible way to listen to podcast and streams.

It serves as a simple social network, helping streamers and listeners to easily access and expose their live content as it centralizes streams from many popular streaming sources.

As a podcaster/streamer, you can expose yourself better - by providing centralized information on previous, present and future streams.

As a listener, you can follow your favorite streamers and keep up to date with their streams.

## Ideology 
The platform strives to be a simple social network as users can follow and engage with each other.
Our philosophy is that there should be no alienation between a streamer and a listener, and we engage and strive to push the interaction between them as possible.
